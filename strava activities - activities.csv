Split training with the club had given me most of those gains and on performance mode, I know I can double down and push better figures.

What else am I plateauing on in life ? Strength when I do put in, is a modest home workout and maybe the split training equivalent would push progress Really efficiently. 
Flexibility and other personal goals too, with a group of people who’s been doing it for 2 decades, you get way better just by association.
